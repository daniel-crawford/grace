# System Architecture for Sentinel RAG
1. Input Processing Layer (Data Ingestion)
-       Audio Data:

        - Use Whisper or SpeechBrain for speech-to-text transcription.
        - Metadata: Timestamp, speaker identification (if available).
        
        Output: Text and embeddings.

-       Visual Data:

        - Use CLIP or BLIP for extracting embeddings and captions.
        - Metadata: Geolocation (if available), image type (satellite, surveillance, etc.).

        Output: Embeddings and descriptive text.

-       Text Data:

        - Directly tokenize and create embeddings using SentenceTransformers or OpenAI embeddings.
        - Metadata: Source (report, communication logs, etc.), context tags.

        Output: Embeddings with metadata.

2. Preprocessing Layer

        - Embedding Creation:
                Standardize all input modalities into vector embeddings.
                Example tools: Hugging Face Transformers, OpenAI APIs, CLIP.

        - Metadata Enrichment:
                Extract relevant information like source details, timestamps, classifications, and enrich embeddings with metadata.

3. Vector Database Layer (Knowledge Base)

-       Database Choice: Use Pinecone, Weaviate, or Milvus for scalability and high-performance vector similarity search.
-       Data Organization:
        - Store embeddings with metadata to enable complex filtering.
        - Index multimodal data in a unified manner.

        - Example: Tag entries as "audio_transcription," "satellite_imagery," "report_analysis," etc.

        Update Mechanism:
        - Handle real-time and batch updates for incoming data streams.
        - Implement version control to track changes in the database.

4. Retrieval Layer
        Query Handling:

        Semantic query translation (text to embedding).
        Multi-modal query support (e.g., retrieve text documents relevant to a satellite image description).
        Use LangChain or custom Python pipelines for orchestration.
        Search Algorithm:

                Perform similarity searches using cosine similarity or other distance metrics.
                Apply metadata-based filters for relevance (e.g., date, security clearance).

5. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Layer
        Contextual Query Handling:

        Pass top-N relevant results to an LLM (e.g., GPT-4 or a fine-tuned model).
        Use LangChain or custom chaining logic to integrate retrieved results into prompts.
        Response Generation:

                Ensure the LLM generates context-aware responses grounded in retrieved data.
                Example: “Generate a summary of key findings in Operation Zone X based on retrieved reports.”


6. Interface Layer (User Interaction)
        Frontend:

        Web App: Build with Streamlit for quick prototyping or React for a more polished experience.
        Features: Upload data, query system, visualize retrieved results.
        CLI:

        Lightweight terminal-based interface for querying and system monitoring.
        APIs:

                Expose REST or GraphQL endpoints for integration with other systems.

7. Security and Governance
        Data Privacy:

        Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
        Access Control:

        Implement role-based access tied to metadata like security clearance.
        Audit Trails:

        Log queries and system updates for accountability.
        Data Flow Diagram
        Input Layer:
        Ingest data (audio, visual, text).
        Processing Layer:
        Transcription, embedding creation, and metadata enrichment.
        Database:
        Store enriched embeddings with metadata in a vector database.
        Retrieval:
        Query vector database and fetch relevant entries.
        LLM Integration:
        Generate responses using retrieved data.
        Output:
        Display responses and relevant context in the interface.
